# Ecommerce-customers-LinearRegression
The project looks at financial planning issue of an E-Commerce firm- Should the firm focus on its mobile app or website ?

I performed EDA to know more about the data.
And develope Viz on the data to know if there is any relation between any values. I attempt at creating a quantifiable relationship between the the time spent on App or time spent on Website vs Length of the Membership.

The coefficient matrix that was found from the model is following: -

Avg. Session Length:   25.981550
Time on App:           38.590159
Time on Website:       0.190405
Length of Membership:  61.279097
