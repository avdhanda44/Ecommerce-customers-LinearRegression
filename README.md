Project Title: "Ecommerce Customers: Mobile App vs. Website Analysis"
Problem Statement:
The problem is to determine whether the E-Commerce firm should focus more on its mobile app or website. This can be achieved by analyzing the relationship between the time spent on the mobile app or website and the length of the membership of the customers. The goal is to establish a quantifiable relationship to understand which platform (app or website) has a stronger influence on customer engagement and loyalty.

- 'Email': Email address of the customer
- 'Address': Mailing address of the customer
- 'Avatar': Avatar chosen by the customer

- 'Time on App': Time spent by the customer on the mobile app in minutes
- 'Time on Website': Time spent by the customer on the website in minutes
- 'Length of Membership': Number of years the customer has been a member
- 'Yearly Amount Spent': Total amount spent by the customer in a year
